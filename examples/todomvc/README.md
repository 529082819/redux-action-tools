# TodoMVC example

This example is mainly copied from [Redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc)

I've changed all actions to [FSA actions](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action);

And the addTodo action has been changed to an async action.

I will add some more usage of redux-action-tools in this example (such as usage of meta) in future commits.
